# Configs

Misc configuration files for various unix-y things.
* Fish shell config
* global gitignore 

## To Do:
* migrate everything from ~/.??* to .config/dotfiles/
* Write an install script to safely symlink it all back to ~
  * Or use dotbot or vcsh or ?
    * No, write your own.
* Expand beyond ~/.??* to config files in other standard locations?
  * Homebrew stuff in /use/local
  * certain files in /etc 
    * Permissions issue, would introduce sudo into the mix
